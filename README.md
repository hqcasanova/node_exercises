PlanetProto & Learnyounode
==========================

Part of the assignments at Bitmaker Labs. For Learnyounode, exercises 1-5 where the only ones mandatory.


PlanetProto - JS Prototypal inheritance
---------------------------------------

* What are prototypes chains

* Message delegation in a prototype chain

* What are function constructors

* What are function prototypes and how to work with them


Learnyounode - Node.js
----------------------

1. Hello World - Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

2. Baby Steps - Write a program that accepts one or more numbers as command-line arguments and prints the sum of those numbers to the console

3. My first async I/O - Write a program that uses a single asynchronous filesystem operation to read a file and print the number of newlines it contains to the console (stdout), similar to running `cat file | wc -l`

4. Filtered ls - Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory, filtered by the extension of the files. You will be provided a directory name as the first argument to your program (e.g. '/path/to/dir/') and a file extension to filter by as the second argument

5. Make it modular - same as previous but using modules. The module must export a single function that takes three arguments: the directory name, the filter string and a callback function

6. HTTP Client - Write a program that performs an HTTP GET request to a URL provided to you as the first command-line argument. Write the String contents of each "data" event from the response to a new line on the console

7. HTTP Collect - Write a program that performs an HTTP GET request to a URL provided to you as the first command-line argument. Collect all data from the server (not just the first "data" event) and then write two lines to the console (stdout). The first line you write should just be an integer representing the number of characters received from the server and the second line should contain the complete String of characters sent by the server

8. Juggling async - you will be provided with three URLs as the first three command-line arguments. You must collect the complete content provided to you by each of the URLs and print it to the console 

9. Time server - Write a TCP time server! Your server should listen to TCP connections on port 8000. For each connection you must write the current date & time in the format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm

10. HTTP File Server - Write an HTTP server that serves the same text file for each request it receives

11. HTTP Uppercase - Write an HTTP server that receives only POST requests and converts incoming POST body characters to upper-case and returns it to the client

12. HTTP JSON API Server - Write an HTTP server that serves JSON data when it receives a GET request to the path '/api/parsetime'
